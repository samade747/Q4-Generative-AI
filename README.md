What is Generative AI?

Introduction & Basics of Generative AI

1. What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a technology that creates entirely new content—such as text, images, music, or code—that did not previously exist, by learning patterns from large data sets through trained AI models. It thinks and creates new ideas just like humans do through their imaginations.

2. Generative AI Vs Traditional AI







Feature



Traditional AI



Generative AI





Work procedure



Analysis, Prediction



Create new content





Example



Spam detection, Face recognition



Write an essay with ChatGPT, create an image with DALL-E





Output

Text, Image, Voice, Code





Way of thinking



Understands the data



Creates new content with trained model data

While traditional AI analyzes and makes judgments based on existing data, generative AI imagines and creates entirely new content.

3. History Of Generative AI





1950: AI concept started (Alan Turing - "Can machines think?")



1980s-90s: Development of Neural Networks



2014: GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) invented—image generation began.



2018-2020: Transformers (like GPT) invented—text generation advanced.



2022-23: Tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and MidJourney triggered a significant boom in generative AI, revolutionizing content creation.

Earlier, AI focused on understanding data; now, it can write, speak, think, and create.

Core Concepts of Generative AI

1. What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. Like humans learn through experience, ML models learn patterns to make decisions or predictions.

Example: Showing a computer 1,000 photos of cats and dogs teaches it to distinguish between them based on patterns.

2. Deep Learning & Neural Networks

Deep Learning, an advanced ML subset, processes large data volumes and solves complex problems using Neural Networks inspired by the human brain. These networks have layers (Input → Hidden Layers → Output) to learn intricate patterns.

In simple words: Neural networks "think" like the brain, passing information through layers.

Example: Deep Learning powers Face ID, self-driving cars, and voice assistants.

3. Supervised Vs Unsupervised Vs Reinforcement Learning

Examples:





Supervised: Email spam detection



Unsupervised: Customer segmentation



Reinforcement: Training robots

4. Discriminative Vs Generative AI Models

GANs, GPT

Types of Generative Models

Generative AI uses models to create new content like images, text, videos, music, etc.

1. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

Introduced in 2014, GANs use two components:





Generator: Creates new data (e.g., images).
Example: Generating a new cartoon character.



Discriminator: Distinguishes real from fake data.
Example: Identifying if an image is real or AI-generated.

They form a feedback loop: the Generator improves by trying to fool the Discriminator.

In simple words: GANs = Artist (Generator) + Judge (Discriminator)

Applications:





Image Generation (photos, artwork)



Deepfake Videos



Style Transfer (photo to painting)



Anime & Cartoon Creation

2. VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)

VAEs compress and reconstruct data, especially images.





Encoding: Compresses data into a smaller representation.



Decoding: Reconstructs data with slight variations.

In simple words: Like digitizing a drawing and recreating it with creative changes.

Applications:





Face generation



Image denoising



Data compression

3. Transformers (Powerful for Text)

Transformers understand and generate language, powering tools like ChatGPT.





Expert at processing long texts



Fast and efficient with parallel processing



Foundation of modern NLP

In simple words: Transformers are AI's language brain.

4. Attention Mechanism

Used in transformers to focus on important words.





Decides word importance in sentences



Gives more "attention" to key words

In simple words: AI focuses like humans do on key parts of text.

Example: In "Samad loves to code websites," AI focuses on "loves," "code," "websites."

5. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

Developed by OpenAI, GPT is the basis for ChatGPT.





Generative: Creates new content



Pre-trained: Trained on vast data



Transformer: Uses transformer architecture

In simple words: GPT reads extensively, then writes creatively.

Applications:





Writing articles



Summarizing content



Translating languages



Creating chatbots



Coding assistance
